# Detecting IoT Botnet Attacks N-BaIoT

This project uses machine learning models to detect botnet attacks on IoT devices using the N-BaIoT dataset.

## Repository Structure

Project_2_Machine_Learning_Modeling
-Data
-Images
-project_2_multiclass.ipynb
-project_2.ipynb
-README.md
-.gitignore

## Notebooks Overview
-project_2 trains a binary classifier to detect whether a network event is benign or an attack
-project_2_multiclass trains a multiclass model to identify specific botnet families and the types of attacks

## REquirements
Install dependencies with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to run
-download dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/442/detection+of+iot+botnet+attacks+n+baiot
-place files in data/ folder
-open notebooks inside jupyter or VS code
-run cells top to bottom
